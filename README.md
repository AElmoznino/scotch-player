# Scotch Player

__Description:__ Music desktop app built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

__Task:__ Build a native desktop app using Electron that plays music from Soundclound (using its API). React is used for the front-end.
The purpose was to learn using Electron and React by doing. I followed Chris Nwamba's tutorial [Build a Music Player with React & Electron](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-music-player-with-react-electron-i-setup-basic-concepts) at Scotch.io.
Use the search bar on top to search for any music on Soundcloud.

__How to use:__

1. `npm install` to install all dependencies.

2. `npm start` runs the app and opens it up in a new Electron window.
